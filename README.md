# DINO-TREX
## Hi everyone, my name is Danh. I am pleased to introduce my first game project using C++ and SDL2. It's a simple game where you navigate T-Rex over obstacles on an endless road, inspired by the famous Google Chrome Dinosaur game. You can use the Space (or Up key) key and the Down key to avoid obstacles, which get faster over time. Try it out and break your own record. Have fun!
